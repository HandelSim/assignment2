2. 9 commits have been done
I used the command git shortlog

3. Last modified at Fri Oct 15 22:23:19 2021
Given by the command git log

4. Branches are used as placeholders for so that commits are easier to reference.
 They are also used as ways to know what to push or pull to or from repositories.

5. git log shows the history of commits. git status shows how up-to-date the repository is compared to your local machine.

6. git log --follow Vehicle.h

7. git log --grep="file"

8. Inheritence is the idea that a child class inherits the properties of its parent class. 
Polymorphism is the idea that a single type can take multiple different forms, like how a shape can be a circle, square, or rectangle.
 Encapsulation is the idea of keeping private information private, whether that be sensitive data or class member variables.

9. The major difference is that the dictator and lieutenant model has three levels of people while the integration manager has two.
Although the developers have a private and public repository in the integration manager model, that is different from having
three separate levels of people.

10. Having 100 developers using the centralized workflow model would be disastrous because there are so many opportunities 
for conflicting code. The dicator and lieutenant model helps cut back these problems by a lot because there is a hierarchy of
lieutenants in between the developers and the central repository. This layer is basically a filtering layer. In any one repository,
there are mush fewer people to conflict with.
